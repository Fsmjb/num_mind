# Num Mind 🎯

> A simple **Number Guessing Game** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — guess the hidden number within limited attempts and get feedback on your guesses!

**Live Demo:** 🔗 *https://fsmjb.github.io/num_mind/*

## 🚀 About

Num Mind is a beginner-friendly web game where players try to guess a randomly generated number. After each guess, the game tells you if your guess was too high or too low until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.

Built using:

* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS** for design
* **JavaScript** for game logic

It’s a great starter project to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and core web development basics — ideal for new contributors. ([MDN Web Docs][1])

## 🧠 How It Works

1. When the page loads, the game generates a random number.
2. The player selects a difficulty or starts guessing.
3. Each guess is validated and compared with the generated number.
4. The UI updates with feedback (too high / too low / correct).
5. Attempts are tracked and the game ends when the number is guessed or attempts finish.
